- 👋 Hi, I’m @wilkintt.
- 👀 I’m interested in RF signal survey and processing, especially for aircraft communications. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about ACARS, the standard format for aircraft pilots, controllers, dispatchers, maintenance crews and others to communicate with each other.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ACARS message processing.
- 📫 How to reach me: email me at wilkintt@yahoo.com.
